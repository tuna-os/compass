#
# These are `corral vmtest --check` commands, which arrive over SSH as root, one
# fresh shell each. They live in a script baked into the test image rather than
# as shell one-liners in the workflow for three reasons: `bash -n` can check
# them before CI does, quoting them through YAML and ssh twice is how subtle
# bugs get in, and the shape of "wait for X, then assert Y" does not survive
# being folded onto one line.
#
# Each subcommand is one assertion, so a failing run names which one broke
# instead of reporting that a compound command exited 1. corral runs every check
# even after one fails, so the report is the whole picture.

# Flatpak's entrypoint IS `compass`, so `compass_cli compass ping` runs
# `compass compass ping` -- rejected by the parser, forever. That cost a
# 30-minute VM run, presenting as "the engine never answered a ping" with a
# perfectly healthy engine sitting there. `crates/compass/tests/vmtest_cli.rs`

  # This splits the one question left about Spike A. Pressing Super alone
  # changes nothing on screen, and the guest does have a keyboard — the
  # evidence check shows an "AT Translated Set 2 keyboard" with an evdev node,
  # so the earlier guess that corral adds no input device was wrong. That
  # leaves two possibilities that look identical from outside:
  #
  #   a. QEMU never delivers the scancode to the emulated keyboard, or
  #   b. it does, and something above the kernel — mutter, the seat, focus —
  #      discards it.
  #
  # Reading the evdev node decides it. Bytes arriving while the host injects a
  # key means the kernel got the event and (b) is the answer; silence means (a),
  # and it is corral's or QEMU's to fix rather than ours.
  #
  # The node is resolved from /proc/bus/input/devices rather than hard-coded to

  #   2. Does Super+Space already belong to something else? GNOME binds it to
  #      the input-source switcher by default. A collision does not stop the
  #      bind; it means the compositor may route the key elsewhere, so

  # Harvest a real desktop-entry corpus from this Bluefin box.
  #
  # Phase 1's gate wants ~500 real entries for Suite 0 ranking parity and there
  # are 27 (§11.2). The harvester's own header asks for "a real desktop —
  # ideally a Bluefin box", and that is exactly what this VM is: a full GNOME
  # application set on the target platform, booted fresh every run.
  #
  # It writes into a scratch directory rather than the repo's corpus path,
  # because nothing here should look like it commits to the repository. The
  # tarball goes out with the artifacts and a person decides what to keep — a
  # corpus is test input that shapes every ranking assertion, and it should not
  # grow by a job quietly appending to it.
  # Are the machine's Flatpak applications in the index? (#105)
  #
  # A Flatpak export is a SYMLINK, not a file. flatpak-dir.c builds it with the
  # prefix `../app/<id>/current/active/export`, so the entry a launcher reads
  # lives in the deploy tree and the exports directory holds only pointers into
  # it. Our sandbox granted the exports directories and not the deploy trees,
  # which meant every Flatpak on the machine was a dangling link inside it --
  # invisible, with no error anywhere, because the scan still lists the name and
  # the read fails one step later.
  #
  # Unit tests pin the shape of that (compass-xdg) and the manifest invariant
  # (xdg_dirs), but only a real session can answer whether the sandbox actually
  # resolves them. That is what this is: two applications installed by flatpak
  # itself, one in the system root and one in the user's, queried through the
  # running engine from inside the Flatpak.
  #
  # The display name is read from the export rather than written here, so the
  # check does not break when an upstream renames its application; the app id is
  # what is asserted, because that is what the index keys on.

    # THE SYSTEM ROOT IS GATED; THE USER ROOT IS RECORDED. The image installs a
    # probe application into the system root only: a container build is the
    # wrong place to populate a USER installation, and two attempts proved it
    # (gpgme has no session to work in, and flatpak refuses `--user` as root).
    # The follow-up installs it in the booted guest from a staged bundle, where
    # there is a real session.
    #
    # So an empty user root is reported as UNCOVERED and does not fail, while a
    # user root that HAS an export is gated exactly like the system one -- the

  # Every gate in this tier asserts a percentage of changed pixels inside a box.
  # That is the only way to prove something reached the screen, and it is bad at
  # everything else: "5.44% of pixels in a box changed" cannot say which row is
  # selected, what the query matched, or what the panel contains, and it moves
  # with the font, the theme and the card geometry. Two runs of this tier were
  # spent on a containment box that had gone stale and was asserting nothing
  # about the launcher at all.
  #
  # `compass_ui::state` logs one line per message (LauncherApp::state_line), so
  # those claims can be made exactly. What this CANNOT do is replace the pixel
  # gates: the line is written by the same code under test and says nothing
  # about whether anything was drawn -- a launcher rendering a blank surface
  # logs exactly this. That is the failure --require-paint exists for, and the
  # two halves answer different questions.
  #
  # Usage: checks.sh ui-state <key=value>...
  # Each argument must appear on the LAST state line. Without arguments the
  # whole sequence is printed and nothing is asserted.
  # What does cold start cost? (#13 §8.5 -- RECORDED, NOT GATED)
  #
  # §8.5 names "cold start to first frame < 120 ms" and nothing has ever
  # measured it. `LauncherApp` logs `first_draw_ms` when Iced asks for the
  # first frame, and this surfaces it.
  #
  # IT IS A FLOOR ON THE SLA, NOT THE SLA, for two reasons stated here so the
  # number is not quoted as something it is not:
  #
  #   * Iced yields that event on `RedrawRequested` -- the compositor asking
  #     for a frame, not a frame reaching the screen. The rendering after it
  #     is unmeasured, and under llvmpipe it is not small.
  #   * The clock starts inside `compass::run`, so dynamic linking is outside
  #     it, and a binary that links wgpu does not link instantly.
  #
  # Both omissions push the figure DOWN, so a reading over 120 ms would be
  # conclusive while one under it is not. Recorded until there are enough
