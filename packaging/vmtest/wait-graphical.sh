#
# This is the VM tier's readiness marker, and it exists because the obvious one
# is wrong. `Started gdm.service` fires the moment systemd starts the unit —
# which is also the moment GDM takes the DRM device and blanks it, several
# seconds before the greeter composites anything. corral captures its final
# frame at readiness and does not retry, so gating on that marker means
# `--require-paint` samples a deliberately blank screen and the run fails with
# "the guest booted but never painted anything" at a framebuffer deviation of
# exactly 0.0000. It is a race, and a run that passes it passed by luck.
#
# So readiness is keyed off a *state* — logind reports a session whose type is
# wayland or x11 — rather than off a unit starting. ADR-0010's rule.
#
# The settle after that state is the one duration here, and it is deliberate: a
# session registers with logind before its compositor draws a first frame, and
# nothing inside the guest can observe "has painted" — the only observer of the
# framebuffer is corral, on the other side of QEMU, and it exposes no wait. Ten
# seconds of llvmpipe is generous for that gap. It is slack after a state, not
# an assertion phrased as a duration.
