//! Opens Compass's databases: a [`rusqlite::Connection`] over SQLCipher,
//! keyed, with the vendored `fuzzy_trigram` tokenizer registered.
//!
//! # Why this crate exists at all
//!
//! The clipboard history is an encrypted SQLCipher database whose FTS5 table
//! declares a tokenizer that ships in this repository as C. Neither is
//! optional: a stock SQLite cannot open the file, and without the tokenizer
//! *every* access to `selection_fts` fails, including a plain `SELECT`. See
//! [ADR-0014](../../../docs/rust-engine/adr/0014-clipboard-storage-is-sqlcipher-plus-a-vendored-tokenizer.md).
//!
//! SQLCipher itself is `libsqlite3-sys`'s `bundled-sqlcipher` build, reached
//! through [`rusqlite`], which this crate re-exports. Callers use that
//! re-export rather than depending on `rusqlite` themselves, so there is one
//! version in the tree and one way to get a connection: [`open`].
//!
//! # Why the `unsafe` is here and not elsewhere
//!
//! The workspace sets `unsafe_code = "forbid"`. This crate declines to inherit
//! that (see its `Cargo.toml`) because the tokenizer registration is a call on
//! a raw `sqlite3*`. The bargain is that the exception is confined: [`open`]
//! returns an ordinary connection, and no other crate in the workspace needs
//! `unsafe` to read a clipboard history.
//!
//! # The ordering this crate exists to enforce
//!
//! `clipboard-db.cpp` opens, keys, registers the tokenizer, then sets pragmas —
//! in that order. It is not stylistic. Registering an FTS5 tokenizer queries
//! the database for the `fts5` API pointer, and on an encrypted database that
//! query fails until the key is set. [`open`] does all of it, so a caller
//! cannot get the order wrong.
