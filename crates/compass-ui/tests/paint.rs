//! The launcher, PAINTED, and the pixels checked.
//!
//! # The tier this fills
//!
//! `docs/rust-engine/RENDER-HARNESSES.md` names three ways to see the launcher
//! and marked the middle one "not built": the browser surrogate is HTML and
//! proves design intent; `iced_test` runs the real widget tree but asserts
//! only structure and layout bounds; pixels existed only in the VM tier,
//! nightly. So nothing on a pull request could catch **a tree that lays out
//! correctly and paints wrong** — a selection colour that stopped applying, a
//! theme that no longer reaches the surface, text drawn in the fill colour.
//!
//! This renders `LauncherApp::view()` through Iced's real renderer and reads
//! the pixels back. It runs in well under a second.
//!
//! # Which backend, stated rather than assumed
//!
//! Iced's renderer is wgpu with a tiny-skia fallback. With no GPU adapter —
//! this container, a stock CI runner — it falls back to tiny-skia, Iced's
//! software rasteriser: the same widget `draw` calls, the same text shaping
//! through cosmic-text, the same primitives, rasterised on the CPU. Every
//! frame records which backend produced it, and [`renderer_is_reported`]
//! prints it, so a run never silently changes what it proved. CI installs a
//! software Vulkan driver so the wgpu path is exercised too.
//!
//! # Invariants, not images
//!
//! A committed PNG compared byte-for-byte reddens whenever a runner changes
//! its font package, and `app.rs` already rejects that for exactly this
//! reason. These assertions are about COLOUR IN REGIONS, tied to the layout
//! bounds the widget tree reports: glyph shapes can move freely without
//! touching them, and a selection that stops painting cannot hide from them.
//!
//! Thresholds were measured before they were set (ADR-0010), on this commit:
//! selection share 0.777 in the selected row against 0.000 in an unselected
//! one; surface share 0.782 in an unselected row; 600+ distinct colours.
