/// branch and left all 79 tests green. The design surrogate did not close it
/// either, because it builds its own DOM from the same tokens and never
/// executes the Iced tree.
///
/// `iced_test` renders the real tree in headless mode, which is what finally
/// makes those branches reachable from a test.
///
/// # Bounds rather than pixels
///
/// `Simulator::snapshot` compares against a committed PNG. That would make the
/// assertion depend on which fonts the machine running it happens to have, and
/// a gate that reddens when a runner image changes its font package is a gate
/// people turn off. Selecting a widget by its text and reading its **layout
/// bounds** asserts the same structure without depending on how the glyphs came
/// out.
/// Input-method behaviour: the "watch for" item on the Phase 1 issue.
///
/// #4 flags IME and screen-reader behaviour with an explicit deadline: "Test
/// both here, not in Phase 5 — if Iced can't do them, ADR-0001 needs
/// revisiting while that is still cheap." Nothing tested it, so the risk was
/// carried unresolved rather than answered.
///
/// # The stack does support it, end to end
///
/// * `winit` 0.30 implements `zwp_text_input_v3` on Wayland
///   (`platform_impl/linux/wayland/seat/text_input/`) and emits
///   `WindowEvent::Ime(Enabled | Preedit | Commit | Disabled)`.
/// * `iced_winit` 0.14 converts those into `Event::InputMethod`
///   (`conversion.rs`), and calls `set_ime_allowed`, `set_ime_cursor_area` and
///   `set_ime_purpose` from `enable_ime`, which runs when a widget asks for an
///   input method — so a focused search field turns the IME on by itself.
/// * `iced_core` carries `InputMethod` and `Preedit`.
///
/// So **ADR-0001 does not need revisiting on this point.** That is a claim
/// about libraries, and libraries change, which is what these tests are for:
/// they fail if a future Iced stops routing composed text to the field.
///
/// # What these do and do not prove
///
/// They drive `Event::InputMethod` through the real widget tree and assert the
/// query is what a CJK or accented commit should leave behind. They do **not**
/// prove a real IME works against a real compositor — that needs ibus or fcitx
/// in the VM tier, and it is a different test. What they rule out is the
/// cheaper and more likely failure: composed text never reaching the field at
/// all, which would make the launcher unusable for anyone typing Japanese,
