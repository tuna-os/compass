//! change can be looked at in a second instead of after a twenty-minute VM
//! run. They agree because they read the same numbers from here — the browser
//! page is served this module as JSON rather than having the palette retyped
//! into CSS, which is how a mock starts lying.
//!
//! What the surrogate proves is layout, colour and state. What it cannot prove
