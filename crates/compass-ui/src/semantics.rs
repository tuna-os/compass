//! What the launcher window means, for assistive technology (ADR-0022 §1).
//!
//! Iced 0.14 has no accessibility tree, so the launcher describes itself:
//! [`Semantics`] is the window as a screen reader should understand it —
//! the search field and its text, the results and which one is selected,
//! the action panel, a form's fields — built from application state by
//! `LauncherApp::semantics` and turned into an [`accesskit::TreeUpdate`]
//! here. Nothing in this module draws or needs a display, so every
//! assertion about what Orca would be told is an ordinary unit test.
//!
//! The tree is described whole on every change; AccessKit compares it with
//! the last one and tells the screen reader only what differs, so a list
//! that did not change is not announced again.
//!
//! # Where the keyboard focus is said to be
//!
//! The launcher's keyboard focus never leaves its search field: the arrow
//! keys move the selection while the field keeps the text. A screen reader
//! only follows the focus, so [`FocusTracker`] reports it where a person
//! would look: on the field while they type, on the selected result once
//! they move through the results, on the action panel's selected action
//! while it is open, on a dialog while one asks. Typing puts it back on the
//! field, which is what keeps the typed text echoed rather than the top
//! result read out at every keystroke.
//!
//! # While a search is in flight
//!
//! Typing clears the results and the engine answers a moment later. Said
//! as it happens, that is the list and the status line removed and added
//! again at every keystroke, a "No results" before each count, and a new
//! first row selected each time, which Orca follows out of the field and
//! then loses when the row goes. So the root describes that moment as
//! [`Body::Pending`], and [`Semantics::settle`] keeps the last description
//! under the field until the answer arrives: the rows are relabelled in
//! place, and the count is said once, when it changes. Found by the Orca
//! gate (`scripts/tier2/orca.sh`, #305).
