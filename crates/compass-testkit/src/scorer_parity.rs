//! Suite 0 rung 1: diff the C++ scorer against the Rust one over the corpus.
//!
//! See `docs/rust-engine/PLAN.md` §8.1a. Suite 0 proper (§8.1) diffs whole
//! *engines*, and cannot run yet: the C++ CLI has no command that emits ranked
//! results and its IPC protocol has no ranked-search method. This diffs the one
//! piece that is reachable today — the scorer — because `vicinae::fuzzy` is a
//! header-only library with no Qt dependency, so the C++ side compiles in about
//! a second with a bare `c++ -std=c++23`.
//!
//! **This is scorer parity, not ranking parity, and the difference matters.**
//! `RootItemManager::searchGroupedByProvider` wraps the scorer in provider
//! bucketing, a separate provider-name score, favourite and enabled filtering
//! and per-item frecency. A green run here does not mean the engines rank
//! alike; it means they score alike, which is necessary and not sufficient.
//!
//! Only ONE corpus parser exists, and it is this file. The probe scores
//! `id<TAB>text` lines handed to it on stdin, so a disagreement about which
//! `Name=` line to take cannot masquerade as a scoring divergence.

/// The first version of this harness enumerated individual divergences, and
/// that worked while the corpus was 115 entries harvested from one Bluefin
/// image: six queries differed, each could be written down, and a seventh would
/// fail the run.
///
/// **The corpus then grew to 738 real entries and the count went to 351
/// divergent queries out of 1685.** Enumerating those is not a declaration, it
/// is surrender: nobody reads a 1407-line exception list, and one that long
/// hides a regression as effectively as having no check at all.
///
/// The small corpus was not evidence of agreement. It was one distribution's
/// stock application set, and it hid the problem.
///
/// So the assertion is a ratchet on the measured totals. It fails when the
/// numbers get WORSE, which is the regression it exists to catch — and it also
/// fails when they get BETTER, because a baseline nobody lowers is a baseline
/// that rots into a rubber stamp. Either way the fix is deliberate: look at
/// what changed, then move the number.
///
/// **These numbers are NOT a defect to drive to zero**, and an earlier version
/// of this comment said they were. `PARITY.md`'s "compass-search — nucleo is
/// not fzf" already records that the Rust matcher wraps `nucleo_matcher` while
/// the C++ side is a vendored fzf, that absolute scores are on different
/// scales, and that the normalized values match "closely". Both shapes counted
/// here are already listed there — #4 (score ignores match position) and #2
/// (nucleo prefers a short scatter where fzf's word-boundary bonuses do not).
/// Choosing nucleo over hand-rolling a matcher is settled (PLAN §10).
///
/// What this adds is the number. "Closely" turns out to be 79.2% of queries
/// over 738 real entries. The ratchet holds a KNOWN divergence still so a
/// nucleo bump or a scoring change cannot move it unnoticed — zero would mean
/// replacing nucleo, which is not this harness's call to force.
///
/// They were also set wrong the first time, and the ratchet caught it: the
/// figures were copied from a run that reported divergences MINUS the ten then
/// declared, so removing the list added those back and the first run failed at
/// 352/1417 against 351/1407. A baseline you cannot get wrong is a baseline
/// that is not checking anything.
