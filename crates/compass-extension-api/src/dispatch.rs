//! Action dispatch: the UI says an action fired, the host routes it, the extension
//! answers.
//!
//! The round trip is modelled as three values — [`ActionRequest`], [`ActionResponse`] and
//! [`DispatchError`] — plus two pieces of state a host needs and would otherwise
//! reinvent per tier: [`ActionIndex`], which is what makes "unknown action id" an
//! answerable question, and [`Pending`], which is what makes "the extension went away
//! mid-action" an answerable one.
//!
//! Nothing here moves bytes. Producing an [`ActionRequest`] and consuming an
//! [`ActionResponse`] is the whole contract; how the two halves reach each other is the
//! caller's problem, and deliberately invisible from this crate.
