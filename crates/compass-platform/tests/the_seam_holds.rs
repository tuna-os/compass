//! The platform seam is a dependency-direction rule, so it is checked as one.
//!
//! [ADR-0013](../../../docs/rust-engine/adr/0013-qt-leaves-the-repository.md)
//! commits macOS and Windows to their own phases, which makes one property
//! load-bearing: the crates every platform shares must not reach a
//! Linux-specific one. That property is invisible in code review — it is a
//! line in a `Cargo.toml`, and it was already violated once. `compass-ui`
//! carried `compass-portals` and `compass-wayland` as dependencies while using
//! neither, and `compass-platform` — the crate *named* for the abstraction —
//! was the Linux launcher.
//!
//! A rule nobody checks is a rule that drifts back, so this reads the
//! manifests.
//!
//! WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM
//!
//! It checks declared dependencies, not portability. A shared crate can be
//! unbuildable on macOS for reasons no manifest shows — a `/proc` path, a
//! Linux-only syscall through `libc`. Only building on macOS proves that, and
//! Phase 9 is where that happens. This catches the specific, cheap, recurring
//! mistake: the edge that should not exist.
