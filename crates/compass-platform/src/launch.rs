//! Launching an application — the interface, not an implementation.
//!
//! # Why this is a trait now
//!
//! This module used to *be* the Linux launcher: `flatpak-spawn --host`, then
//! the XDG `OpenURI` portal, then a direct spawn, in a crate named
//! `compass-platform` that depended on `compass-portals`. That is an
//! implementation wearing the name of an abstraction, and
//! [ADR-0013](../../../docs/rust-engine/adr/0013-qt-leaves-the-repository.md)
//! makes it a problem rather than a curiosity: Qt leaves the repository, so
//! macOS and Windows get their own phases, and every phase that lands before
//! the seam exists is written against the shape this crate has today.
//!
//! The Linux implementation now lives in `compass-platform-linux` and is
//! selected in the `vicinae` binary. This crate names what a launcher *is*.
//!
//! # Why the future is boxed
//!
//! `async fn` in traits is stable, but it is not `dyn`-compatible, and the
//! whole point here is to hold an `Arc<dyn AppLauncher>` chosen at
//! composition. Boxing the future is the cost of that, and it is paid once per
//! launch — not once per keystroke.
