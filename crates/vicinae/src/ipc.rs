//! Talking to a running engine, and explaining it when there isn't one.
//!
//! The interesting part of this module is [`not_running`]. Every one of these
//! commands is normally typed by a person who has just bound it to a key, and
//! the most common outcome on a fresh machine is that nothing is listening yet.
//! `Connection refused (os error 111)` tells that person nothing they can act
//! on; it does not even name the path that was refused.
