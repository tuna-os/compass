//! The engine: the thing that actually runs.
//!
//! Everything else in this workspace is a library, and every `vicinae`
//! subcommand until now has been a *client* looking for a server that did not
//! exist. This module is that server.
//!
//! # Headless on purpose
//!
//! This engine has no window of its own and never opens one. It serves the
//! requests that do not need one — [`Request::Ping`], [`Request::Query`],
//! [`Request::Doctor`], [`Request::Shutdown`] — always, on any machine,
//! display or not.
//!
//! [`Request::Show`], [`Request::Hide`] and [`Request::Toggle`] are forwarded
//! to a **resident launcher window** that attached itself over the same socket
//! ([ADR-0015](../../../docs/rust-engine/adr/0015-the-launcher-window-is-resident.md)).
//! With no window attached they are **refused**, with [`ErrorKind::Unsupported`]
//! and a message saying how to start one.
//!
//! Refusing matters more than it looks. `Response::Ack` means "the side effect
//! was performed"; answering `Ack` to `Show` when nothing can be shown would
//! make a client unable to tell a working engine from a windowless one, and
//! would make UI bring-up debug a lie instead of a gap.
//!
//! What it *does* serve is a genuine vertical slice — index the machine's
//! applications, rank a query against them with frecency, answer over the same
//! socket the C++ engine uses — and all of it is exercisable with no display,
//! which is why it is the part built first.
