//! The engine: the thing that actually runs.
//!
//! Everything else in this workspace is a library, and every `vicinae`
//! subcommand until now has been a *client* looking for a server that did not
//! exist. This module is that server.
//!
//! # Headless on purpose
//!
//! There is no `compass-ui` crate yet, so this engine has no window. It serves
//! the requests that do not need one — [`Request::Ping`], [`Request::Query`],
//! [`Request::Doctor`], [`Request::Shutdown`] — and **refuses** the three that
//! do, with [`ErrorKind::Unsupported`] and a message saying why.
//!
//! Refusing matters more than it looks. `Response::Ack` means "the side effect
//! was performed"; answering `Ack` to `Show` when nothing can be shown would
//! make a client that later grows a window unable to tell a working engine from
//! this one, and would make the first UI bring-up debug a lie instead of a gap.
//!
//! What it *does* serve is a genuine vertical slice — index the machine's
//! applications, rank a query against them with frecency, answer over the same
//! socket the C++ engine uses — and all of it is exercisable with no display,
//! which is why it is the part built first.
