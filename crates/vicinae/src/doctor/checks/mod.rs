//! The individual diagnostic checks.
//!
//! Every function here is a pure function of its arguments. Nothing reads the
//! process environment, touches the real filesystem or opens the real session
//! bus: those arrive as [`Env`](crate::doctor::env::Env),
//! [`FsProbe`](crate::doctor::fs::FsProbe) and
//! [`BusProbe`](crate::doctor::bus::BusProbe). That is what makes "no session
//! bus, no portal, GNOME with the extension uninstalled" something a unit test
//! can construct in three lines, and it is why `PLAN.md` §8.6's demand that
//! absence be detected as accurately as presence is checkable at all.
//!
//! Each function takes the *narrowest* inputs it needs rather than a single
//! god-context, so a test for the session-type check cannot accidentally
//! depend on the bus.
//!
//! # Where a check lives
//!
//! One submodule per subsystem, so adding a probe for one does not mean
//! editing a file that holds the other three:
//!
//! * [`session`] — session type, runtime directory, IPC socket.
//! * [`portal`] — session bus reachability and the XDG desktop portal.
//! * [`desktop`] — which desktop this is, and our GNOME Shell extension.
//! * [`sandbox`] — Flatpak detection and the application directories.
//! * [`input`] — the input server behind snippet keyword expansion.
//! * [`a11y`] — whether a screen reader is on, given the launcher has no tree.
//!
//! Every check is re-exported here, so a caller says `checks::session_type`
//! without knowing or caring which file it is in. `doctor::mod` assembles the
//! report from those flat paths and is unchanged by this layout.
