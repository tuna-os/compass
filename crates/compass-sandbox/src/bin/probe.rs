//! Makes one call the sandbox should refuse and says what the kernel answered.
//!
//! The boundary tests need a program that issues a denied call on purpose.
//! Nothing on a stock system does that reliably: `unshare` needs namespace
//! privileges the machine may not give (a GitHub runner does not), and
//! `strace` is not installed everywhere. So this is that program.
//!
//! Each call is chosen so that the answer *without* a filter is an errno the
//! filter never gives, which is what makes "denied" distinguishable from
//! "failed":
//!
//! - `ptrace` (the default): `ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, 0)`. Process 0 does not
//!   exist, so unfiltered the kernel answers `ESRCH` having looked at the
//!   argument; behind the filter, `EPERM` before it looks.
//! - `raw-socket`: `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, 0)`. Unfiltered the kernel
//!   finds no raw protocol 0 and answers `EPROTONOSUPPORT` before it checks
//!   `CAP_NET_RAW`, root or not; behind the filter, `EPERM`.
//! - `packet-socket`: `socket(AF_PACKET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0)`. Unfiltered this is
//!   `EPERM` for an unprivileged process and a socket for root, so only a
//!   privileged control can tell the two apart; the tests say so.
//! - `stream-socket`: `socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)`, which must work
//!   behind the filter: the control that the socket rules are not a ban on
//!   sockets.
//! - `alloc-512m`: reserves 512 MiB, answering `ENOMEM` when the data limit
//!   refuses it.
//!
//! It exits 0 either way and prints `errno=<name>`, or `errno=ok` when the
//! call succeeded: the test reads the name, because "the program failed" is
//! exactly the ambiguity being avoided.
