//! The syscall filter that goes on top of the filesystem boundary.
//!
//! Landlock says which files a worker may touch; this says which kernel
//! interfaces it may reach at all. They are complementary and neither
//! substitutes for the other: `ptrace` reads another process's memory without
//! opening a single file, and `init_module` leaves the filesystem entirely.
//!
//! # A denylist, not an allowlist, and why
//!
//! PLAN.md §6 says "seccomp for the syscall filter" without saying which
//! shape. An allowlist is stronger and is what a purpose-built binary should
//! have. The thing being confined here is Node, whose syscall surface is large,
//! version-dependent and allowed to change under us — an allowlist would be
//! wrong on the next Node release, in the direction that breaks every
//! extension. So the default is a small denylist of interfaces no extension
//! runtime has any business reaching, each of which is a known route to
//! something worse.
//!
//! This is a deliberate, recorded weakening of the spec. An allowlist becomes
//! possible if the worker is ever something we build rather than something we
//! embed.
//!
//! # Everything denied answers `EPERM`, not `SIGSYS`
//!
//! A killed process and a refused call look very different to whoever is
//! debugging an extension at the time. `EPERM` reaches Node as an ordinary
//! error, with a stack.
