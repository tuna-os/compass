//! Error type for portal calls.
//!
//! Note what is deliberately *not* an error here:
//!
//! - A missing portal is not an error of the crate. [`Portals::connect`] only
//!   fails when there is no session bus at all; a missing interface surfaces as
//!   [`Availability`] and, if the caller ignores that and calls anyway, as
//!   [`PortalError::Unavailable`] — which callers are expected to treat as a
//!   degraded feature, not a failure.
//! - The user denying a permission dialog is not an error either. It comes back
//!   as [`ShortcutsOutcome::Denied`](crate::shortcuts::ShortcutsOutcome::Denied) or
//!   [`Dismissed`](crate::OpenOutcome::Dismissed), so it can be matched on
//!   rather than string-matched.
//!
//! [`Portals::connect`]: crate::Portals::connect
