//! Whether a given XDG desktop portal interface is usable, and what we lose
//! when it is not.
//!
//! Every portal this crate speaks is optional. `PLAN.md` §3.5.1 requires that
//! nothing in the critical path hard-fails when a portal is missing, and
//! §3.4/`REFERENCES.md` §3.5 make the reason concrete: on GNOME 50/51 the
//! GlobalShortcuts backend exists and is the only hotkey path, while
//! `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr` ships **no** GlobalShortcuts backend at all. On
//! Sway, river and labwc a portal *frontend* is running and owns
//! `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop`, but the interface is simply not exported.
//!
//! That is why availability is decided by reading the interface's `version`
//! property and not by asking whether a bus name is owned: the bus name is
//! owned in both the working and the broken case.
