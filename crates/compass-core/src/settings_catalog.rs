//! Every setting the settings view edits: where it lives in `vicinae.json`,
//! what it takes, what it is when unset, and which C++ setting it stands for.
//!
//! The C++ settings window reads and writes its values through
//! `GeneralSettingsModel`'s properties, the root item manager and each
//! builtin provider's `preferences()`. Compass keeps one table instead, so the
//! view, the engine that writes the file ([`apply`]) and the tests agree on
//! the keys. A key is always one the Rust engine reads; a C++ setting nothing
//! in Compass reads is in [`NOT_IN_COMPASS`] with the reason, rather than
//! written to a file that would then look as though it were honoured (the
//! same rule `config_migration` follows).
