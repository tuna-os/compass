//! Ranking that combines fuzzy match quality with launch history.
//!
//! [`compass_search::rank`] answers "how well does this item match what was typed". A launcher
//! also has to answer "and is this the one you always pick", which is what [`crate::frecency`]
//! records. This module is the join: match score plus up to [`compass_search::FRECENCY_WEIGHT`]
//! points of frecency, on the same 0-100 scale the matcher uses.
