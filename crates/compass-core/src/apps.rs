//! The application index: `.desktop` files turned into searchable items.
//!
//! # Scanning and precedence
//!
//! The index walks the XDG application directories in precedence order —
//! `$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications` first, then each `$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications` — and recurses
//! into subdirectories. A file's *desktop file id* is its path relative to the applications
//! directory with each `/` replaced by `-`, so
//! `/usr/share/applications/kde4/konsole.desktop` has the id `kde4-konsole.desktop`.
//!
//! **The first directory to supply an id wins, and later directories with the same id are
//! ignored.** That is what makes a file dropped in `~/.local/share/applications` an override
//! rather than a duplicate. Shadowing happens on the *id*, before any visibility check: if the
//! winning file is `Hidden=true` the application is gone, it does not fall back to the system
//! copy. The specification is explicit that `Hidden` means "deleted", and falling back would make
//! it impossible for a user to remove a system entry.
//!
//! # What is indexed
//!
//! * `Type=Application` entries only. `Link` and `Directory` entries are not launchable
//!   applications and belong to other providers.
//! * Entries passing [`DesktopEntry::should_show`] against the configured desktops, i.e. not
//!   `Hidden`, not `NoDisplay`, and allowed by `OnlyShowIn`/`NotShowIn`.
//! * Every `[Desktop Action …]` group of an included entry becomes its own [`AppItem`], because
//!   "Firefox → New Private Window" is a thing people search for directly.
//!
//! # `TryExec`
//!
//! An entry whose `TryExec` names a binary that does not resolve is **indexed but marked
//! unlaunchable** ([`AppItem::launchable`]), not dropped. See [`AppIndexBuilder::include_unlaunchable`]
//! for the reasoning.
