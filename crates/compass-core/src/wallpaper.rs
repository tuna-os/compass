//! Setting the desktop wallpaper, on whichever desktop this is.
//!
//! A port of `WallpaperManager` and its six Linux backends
//! (`src/server/src/services/wallpaper/`), minus the process spawning and the
//! D-Bus calls.
//!
//! # Six desktops, six vocabularies for the same five words
//!
//! Every backend supports roughly the same five fits and every one calls them
//! something different — GNOME says `zoom`, KDE says `2`, swww says `crop`,
//! hyprpaper says `cover`. Getting one of those wrong does not fail: it sets
//! the wallpaper stretched when the person asked for it cropped, and nothing
//! anywhere reports a problem. So the tables are what port, and the tests are
//! a table each.
//!
//! Two of the five are not supported everywhere and degrade rather than
//! failing, which the C++ comments call out and which the tests name: swww has
//! no tile mode and falls back to cropping, and hyprpaper has no centre mode
//! and sends an empty one.
