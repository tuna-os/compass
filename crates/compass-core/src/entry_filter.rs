//! What the file indexer refuses to look at.
//!
//! Vicinae's curated policy: the exclusion lists, the `.noindex` convention,
//! machine trash directories, and the `CACHEDIR.TAG` signature check. The
//! traversal and ignore-file machinery that used to live here (`EntryFilter`,
//! `GitIgnoreReader`) now sits on the `ignore` crate in
//! [`crate::file_walk`], which matches real gitignore semantics instead of
//! the old filename-only hack.
//!
//! # Every rule here exists because something once made the index useless
//!
//! An indexer that walks `/proc` never finishes. One that walks
//! `~/.cargo/registry` fills the index with thousands of vendored source files
//! nobody searches for, and the one file they *did* want is ranked below them.
//! So this is a long list of specific names rather than a general rule, and it
//! is worth porting exactly: a name dropped from the list is not a bug anyone
//! sees as a bug, it is a search that quietly stops being useful.
