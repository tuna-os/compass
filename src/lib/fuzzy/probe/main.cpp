// Suite 0 rung 1: expose the C++ scorer's ranking so it can be diffed against
// the Rust port's. See docs/rust-engine/PLAN.md §8.1a.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
//
// Suite 0 is specified (§8.1) as a differential harness over both engines, and
// it could not run: the C++ CLI has no command that emits ranked results, and
// figura/ipc.fig has no ranked-search method — its only query is fsQuery, over
// files. Adding that surface to the shipping engine is real work in a tree we
// are deleting, so it is scoped separately (§8.1a rung 2).
//
// What made a cheaper first rung possible is that `vicinae::fuzzy` is a
// header-only INTERFACE library with no Qt dependency: this file compiles and
// links with a bare `c++ -std=c++23 -Isrc/lib/fuzzy/include`, in about a
// second, with no CMake, no Qt, no server and no display. That is the whole
// reason this probe is affordable to run on every PR.
//
// WHY IT PARSES NOTHING
//
// It reads `id<TAB>text` lines on stdin and scores them. It deliberately does
// NOT read the corpus itself, because then two parsers would exist — this one
// and the Rust driver's — and a disagreement about which `Name=` line to take
// would show up as a scoring divergence. One parser, on the Rust side; this
// binary only scores strings it is handed.
//
// SCOPE, so a green diff is not over-read: this is the SCORER, not the engine's
// ranking. RootItemManager::searchGroupedByProvider wraps it in provider
// bucketing, a separate provider-name score, favourite and enabled filtering,
// and per-item frecency. Scorer parity is necessary for ranking parity and is
// not the same thing.
