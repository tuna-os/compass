"""Compare two screenshots and say where they differ.

Written because corral's luminance standard deviation cannot answer the one
question this tier most needs answered — "did a window appear" — and pretending
otherwise cost three runs and a retracted conclusion. Five frames across two
jobs all reported deviation 0.1564 to four decimal places while showing
visibly different things, including one with a 640x480 launcher in it.

Pixels can answer it. This decodes PNG without Pillow, which is not available
on the runner and is not worth a dependency for two hundred lines of zlib and
an unfilter loop.

Usage:
    framediff.py BEFORE AFTER [--min-percent P] [--expect-box X0 Y0 X1 Y1]
                              [--ignore-box X0 Y0 X1 Y1]

Exit status is 0 when every requested assertion holds, 1 when one does not, and
2 when the files cannot be read. With no assertions it only reports, which is
how it should be used until there is a measurement to set them from.
