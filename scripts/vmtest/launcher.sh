# Drive the launcher: open it in the guest, look at the screen, type at it.
#
# Usage: scripts/vmtest/launcher.sh <artifact-dir> <vm-name>
#
# WHY THIS IS NOT A `--check`
#
# Same reason as spike-a.sh. The question here is "did a launcher appear on
# screen", and the only observer of the framebuffer is corral, on the host side
# of QEMU. Nothing inside the guest can answer it — ADR-0010 says so and it is
# still true. So the sequence straddles guest and host, which means running
# after `corral vmtest` returns, against a VM it was told to leave up.
#
# WHAT IS GATED, AND WHAT IS ONLY RECORDED
#
# Gated: the launcher process starts and stays up (checks.sh, in the guest),
# and the screen still passes corral's own blank test with the launcher open.
# That threshold is corral's, not one invented here.
#
# Recorded, not gated: the three luminance deviations. It is tempting to assert
# that opening a launcher raises the deviation, and it probably does — but this
# has never been measured once, and ADR-0010 is explicit that inventing a pixel
# threshold before seeing real numbers is how a tier starts flaking. Spike A and
# Spike B both shipped gating on nothing but "produced a report", for the same
# reason. Once a few runs have published numbers, the gate can be set from data
# rather than from a guess, and that is a two-line change to this file.

# Kept, and labelled, rather than deleted. Pressing Super alone, which opens
# the Activities overview, leaves the framebuffer byte-identical, so this step
# cannot currently type anything and its screenshot is evidence about key
# delivery rather than about the launcher.
#
# It previously said injection "does not reach this session at all". That is
# WRONG and was written before the evdev capture existed. Spike A's
# keyboard-capture now answers it directly, and the chain is longer than that:
#
#   QEMU delivers the scancode          yes — 288 bytes captured on the evdev
#                                        node while the key was injected
#   the guest kernel sees it            yes — same evidence
#   gnome-shell holds the keyboard      yes — event0..event3 open on its fds
#   the portal grants the binding       yes — "portal available | bind granted"
#   the shortcut fires                  NO  — "activated False"
#
# So the loss is above the kernel, in a session whose compositor is holding the
# device it is losing events from. "Does not reach the session" would point at
# corral or QEMU, which the capture rules out.
#
# The seat is ruled out too, as of the run that first printed the untruncated
# diagnostic: the AT keyboard IS on seat0, and the capture decodes clean
# LEFTMETA press and release on event1 -- the very node gnome-shell holds open.
#
# What narrows it furthest is that pressing Super ALONE leaves the framebuffer
# byte-identical (deviation 0.1576 before and after). Super alone is GNOME's own
# binding for the Activities overview. So this is not our portal shortcut
# failing to route: the compositor is inert to injected input generally. The
# remaining suspect is that logind has the session's devices PAUSED, which keeps
# their file descriptors open, which is why "holds event1" and "receives nothing
# from event1" are both true at once. `compositor-input` now reports the
# session's Active state, which is what tells those apart.
#
# Deleting it would lose the regression check for free — the day injection
# starts working, this frame changes and says so. Leaving it unlabelled would
# be worse than either, because it reads as a test of the launcher's input
# handling, which it is not.

# The first assertion in this tier derived from a measurement rather than from
# an assumption, and the reason it exists is that its absence let a wrong
# conclusion stand for three runs.
#
# corral's luminance deviation cannot answer "did a window appear": five frames
# across two jobs all read 0.1564 to four decimal places while showing visibly
# different things, one of them containing a 640x480 launcher. Pixels can, and
# framediff.py counts them.
#
# The numbers are taken from two consecutive runs that agreed to the pixel:
# 84150 changed (8.22%) in a box at x 335..942, y 152..796, against a window
# configured 640x480 centred, i.e. x 320..960, y 160..640. The gate is set well
# below and around that — 3% rather than 8.22%, and a box with room on every
# side — because the point is to catch "nothing was drawn", not to pin the
# exact pixels of a theme. A tighter bound would break on the first font change
# and teach everyone to ignore it.
#
# THE TOP BAR IS IGNORED, and that is not a loosening of the gate.
#
# --expect-box asserts the changed region lies WITHIN the box, which silently
# also asserts that nothing else on the screen changed between the two frames.
# That was never the intent, and it is not true: GNOME's top bar carries a
# clock. It cost a red run to find out, and the two runs say exactly what
# happened:
#
#   passing   84077 changed  box x 335..942  y 152..796
#   failing   84172 changed  box x 335..942  y  10..796
#
# Ninety-five extra pixels, in the top bar, with the launcher's own footprint
# identical to the pixel on both axes. A clock digit turning over dragged miny
# from 152 to 10 and failed a gate about whether a window appeared. Two
# calibration runs happened not to cross a minute boundary; this one did.
#
# So the shell's own furniture is excluded from the comparison rather than the
# box being widened to swallow it. Widening would have made "the launcher
# painted at the top of the screen" pass, which is a real failure this gate
# should keep catching. Excluding y < 140 keeps the containment assertion sharp
# for the whole region the launcher can legitimately occupy, and --min-percent
# still requires a real window's worth of pixels inside it: a launcher that
# painted only in the ignored strip would now change ~0% and fail there.
