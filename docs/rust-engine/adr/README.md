# Architecture decision records

Short records of decisions that were expensive to make and would be expensive to revisit. Each
states what was decided, what it costs, and what would make us change our mind.

An ADR is not a promise. "Superseded by ADR-00NN" is a normal and healthy outcome; silently
drifting away from a recorded decision is not.

| [0006](./0006-fuzzy-coherence-classifier.md) | Reconstruct fzf's coherence signal over nucleo's indices | Accepted |
| [0007](./0007-fork-posture-and-platform-scope.md) | Hard fork in practice; Linux-first; naming superseded by ADR-0012, scope by ADR-0013 | Partly superseded |

| [0014](./0014-clipboard-storage-is-sqlcipher-plus-a-vendored-tokenizer.md) | The clipboard store is SQLCipher plus a vendored FTS5 tokenizer; the Rust engine links both | Superseded by ADR-0017 |
